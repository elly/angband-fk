   This is file of suggestions for improvements to Angband/ideas that I have
had but not implemented yet. Hopefully, a lot of these fixes will be added
sometime in the future.

	Currently, the Chaos, Gold, Bronze, Shimmering, Law, Balance Dragon
Scale Mails do not work properly - they only do damage of a particular sort to
creatures at the moment. Ideally, Bronze should confuse creatures in its are,
Gold should stun etc.
	Add some more monster pits, particularly Giant pits.
	Have the no. of turns played printed on the character sheet (converted
to days gametime perhaps?) and perhaps have particular monsters appearing at
particular times of the day e.g. undead more at night etc.
	Have more resists for creatures... chaos, disenchantment, sound,
confusion etc. and even spell resist. I mean, you can have em, so why not
them?
	Add Chris Wilde's targetting code - not sure about upsetting the
balance too much with this one, but it's an idea.
	Instead of having to wait until a rod has recharged before being able
to use it, have a chance of getting it to work before being fully charged, and
if it fails, destroy the rod.
	Different types of dungeon level... some with more corridors etc.,
some with more rooms.
	Write the quest plane code again, the old code was somehow lost, and
all I have left are the maps for the elemental and dragon planes. The idea is
that at certain levels there are particular quests to do before you can
proceed... the code will take a fair bit of writing though. I am including the
quest files in the tar.
	A new spell for mages and/or priests... set recall spell.
	New weapon to wield... the rod. Then we can have more Tolkien sceptres
and rods actually in the code and useful.
	Digging/quiver slots.
	The priest spell unbarring ways is in the wrong book really... needs
to be moved as well as adding more mage and priest spells. Priest spell of
cure poison should come at a lower level - currently mages get it earlier.
	Add two new flags for creatures... environment (things like cold,
desert etc.) and a friendly flag... add creatures that don't attack you, maybe
aid you instead.
	Perhaps have injuries to characters to give a more authentic feel...
scars and things to make your character more personal.
	Shouldn't be able to genocide uniques, or polymorph other creatures
into uniques.
	Add efreeti, djinni as high level elementals.
	Add a command to show (or dump to a file) total numbers of particular
creatures killed, as well as the total killed.
	Larger than normal are of effect for powerful ball spells/dragon
breath.
	Perhaps have the caster take some damage from ball spells if they are
cast too close.
	Let monsters carry specific treasure (only Morgoth does this at the
moment, with the Iron Crown and Grond)
	Communication with monsters.
	Monsters can use items too.
	Stores in the dungeon.
	Different kinds of floor.
